# Sudoku Solver

### Revisiting this project, writing the solution as a constraint satisfaction problem
### I adapted the framework found in Classic Computer Science Problems in Python by David Kopec
### See https://freecontent.manning.com/constraint-satisfaction-problems-in-python/ for details

### I took the backtracking search function and adapted it to this use case

### At this time I have only tested the code on easy problems, which it is able to solve

### To solve a puzzle, enter the puzzle in puzzle design at the bottom of the file
### Blank cells are represented with 0
