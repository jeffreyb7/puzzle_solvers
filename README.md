# Sudoku Solver

### I adapted the method found in Classic Computer Science Problems in Python by David Kopec
### See https://freecontent.manning.com/constraint-satisfaction-problems-in-python/ for details

### The backtracking function is unchanged, I just added the remaining pieces needed for this use case

### To solve a puzzle, enter the puzzle in puzzle design at the bottom of the file
### Blank cells must be represented with 0
### If you find a valid puzzle that it isn't able to solve, let me know!
