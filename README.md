# Sudoku Solver

### Revisiting this project, writing the solution as a constraint satisfaction problem
### I adapted the framework found in Classic Computer Science Problems in Python by David Kopec
### See https://freecontent.manning.com/constraint-satisfaction-problems-in-python/ for details

### The backtracking function is unchanged, I just adapted the rest of the framework to this use case

### To solve a puzzle, enter the puzzle in puzzle design at the bottom of the file
### Blank cells are represented with 0
### If you find a valid puzzle that it isn't able to solve, let me know!
